## Mentors

After I came out to my family. I started finding it a lot easier to make friends. This became my highest priority. The night I first met Alex I was also introduced to Natalia, my first mentor. Natalia and I quickly bonded over passions for make up and dress. I admired Natalia a lot for the confidence that she demonstrated and the fallibility she showed as she worked to improve her presentation. She was always great about giving constructive feedback if you were interested, but never pushy either.

Over many months, Natalia and I made plans to hang out in the lgbtq village of Toronto night after night. We had a shared drive to grow and experiment with makeup and dress. She pushed me in ways that I wanted to be pushed because I didn't want to be an awkward, looking crossdresser in the back of the room. I wanted to be able to hold my head high in pride at the skills I had developed. Confidence in dress, was confidence in life.

Around the same time, I made friends with a trans woman from Dubai named Lorna. She just about stunned me the first time I met her because her makeup and dress were so well put together. She had a clear sense of taste for higher fashion and the same passion for improvement that I shared with Natalia. Lorna would visit Toronto from time to time for a few weeks or a month and when she was in town she was eager to get out and socialize. We would meet for drinks, chat over martinis and compliment each other's outfits and makeup. We would chat about navigating men and it's many challenges.

Natalia and Lorna both had reasons to leave Toronto at a similar time the following Spring and it left me very empty for a while to lose these friends. Without them I had worried I'd have no one to get drinks and watch amateur drag with at the Well on a Wednesday night. No one to go dancing with at El Convento Rico on a Saturday. I had grown so much with them, but it was time for the training wheels to come off and find my own independence.
