## Pay It Forward

After spending enough time, building my own confidence existing in public and thriving with the help of friendships, I felt like I wanted to give more back to people who were in the situation I once was.

From time to time when navigating social media and dating sites you will meet folks who say they look up to you and want your help. Who would I be to deny this to anyone who spoke to me after such an extension of gratuity from others helped me?

I have tried on many occasions with varying levels of success to help other people come out in public. Unfortunately, I have also seen many people disappear on me suddenly, come up with excuses, or simply admitthey don't think they're ready when the time comes.

This can be frustrating to deal with because you will spend time warming up to someone and trying to champion for them before they deliver that news that they can't really go through with what they asked you for. It's important to remain patient through these experiences and just let people do things in their own time but that doesn't mean that you have to wait for them to be ready and entertain their indecision. Give them a shot and if it doesn't work out, let them know that they may have to try with someone else when ready. Encourage them not to give up if this is important to them.

One other thing that can be very challenging with navigating the closeted is that they will inevitably harbour a lot of internalized transphobia, and that can be projected on you. This is actually potentially one of the riskiest parts of helping people in situations like these, because you should not be letting yourself be brought down in order to try to bring them up. In my opinion, it is better to hold yourself in high standard and not waiver, because you set a better example of who they need to become by not placating their apprehensions.

Help who you can. Don't burn yourself out. You come first and you still set a good examplefor them by existing alone.
