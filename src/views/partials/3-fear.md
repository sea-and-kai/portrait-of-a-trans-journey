## Fear

When I was still closeted, I tried to have a more serious relationship dynamic with someone. It started with warmth and attention, but within 5 days he was attempting Total Power Exchange with me non-consensually.

I had a trans friend I was lightly dating and he told me to break it off with her, and I did, but we still had a movie night planned that week just as friends. Nonetheless I was still accused of being unfaithful and not texting him enough during the movie night and he was livid with me. I remember this moment vividly where I was with my friend, Anna, and I picked up my phone to see a message from him saying I didn’t text him enough, and Anna just saw my body language totally shift into a pensive, distracted state, and we had to wrap this up shortly after so I could deal with it. When she left, despite my explaining he was insistent I was unfaithful. I was telling him he was pushing my limits but he refused to back down and just made me feel like unworthy trash. We argued so much and he just wanted me to yield to him. My limits didn’t matter.

In any case I dumped him that night. Then he started persuing my direct friends shortly after, including Anna! He shit talked a bunch about me to one friend because we had a shared online photo together. Honestly, I don’t know how he thought shit talking a trans girl to another trans girl was going to work out in his favour, but he tried.

In any case, I felt a bit terrorized by him for a little while, both at the conclusion of our short engagement as well as the subsequent weeks. I admittedly feel a little damaged by it. 

I flashbacks to being completely scorned for disappointing my partner. 

I guess I just wanted to share this so you know a little of my past trying to seek dynamics and if I am odd or fragile about something I might be me re-wiring my brain a little away from a traumatic past relationship.

It was one of the last people I met before I concluded I HAD to come out to family for my own safety and wellness, because predators lurk in the discreet corners of queer dating.
