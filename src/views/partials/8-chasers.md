## Chasers

A 'chaser' is a cis man who can't get his shit together when it comes to his trans attraction. In the process of navigating his own bi-curiosity he contacts trans women to mostly objectify them, flop on plans made, and compartmentalize them in a space reserved for fetishes.

'Admirer' is a term you also hear for trans-attracted men that can behave a bit more appropriately, though that doesn't necessarily mean they want to do anything other than send polite praise and encouragement from a distance.

What this adds up to is an inordinate number of trans-attracted men not showing up for us when push comes to shove, that is, anywhere but private quarters.

I've had men interested in me forwardly say they are straight, as though I'm deeply interested in their orientation. I don't really care. What I know for sure is that gay men aren't into me, because gay men are looking for masculine men. So if you're seeking to meet trans women, you aren't doing what gay men do. 

I have many trans friends who date other trans women and avoid navigating cis men altogether. I get it. Even though I feel mostly attracted to men these days, I find myself frequently thinking I could deal with so much less garbage treatment, so much less trans misogyny, if I just dated other trans women. 

Trans/Trans romance is often abbreviated as T4T. I have found T4T oriented folks often have an extremely low opinion of chasers/admirers and little to no sympathy for their circumstances. I find myself on the other side of this though. I feel like finding ways to build trans attracted men up and reduce the stigma would improve things for all trans women, because it implies a societal shift in public opinion. It would also hold them accountable to better behavior if we publicly accepted dating trans women as normal.

What this looks like exactly, I'm not sure. I can almost hear the hisses and boos from trans women as I say "Can we give them a chance? Can we do something to make this space better for them too?". Afterall, for all the mistreatment they feed us, why would we owe them a damn thing?

Both ourselves and the chasers are living in a society that stigmatizes us for what we like and how we live. We both need that stigma to go away. Shame drives men to compartmentalize these feelings. Compartmentalizing the feelings makes them come out in weird ways. Trans women end up experiencing the results of those weird outbursts first hand on socials, dating sites, and on quiet street corners when noone else is around. It hurts our safety and our mental health.

So what is the potential solution? I think one solution could be safer community spaces for interacting together. Meetups with strict codes of conduct that protect trans women against harassment. Creating a safe space for trans women to meet each other as first priority, then letting allies and admirers in to events that explicitly welcome them, after trans community trust is strongly established. This is just an idea that I'm currently working on and will potentially try to organize in the future.
