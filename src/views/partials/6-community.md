## Community

Over the course of the last few years, I've managed to make a lot of friends with other trans women and other gender non-conforming folks. There's been a lot of positive outcomes from this that I couldn't have necessarily predicted. After I came out to my family, I started opening my home to guests and hosting small parties for friends. Small parties grew into medium size parties, and medium size parties grew into ones about as big as I could fit in my place.

Through social media, dating sites, chat groups, and other peoples connections, I've managed to form quite a network of supportive people around me and also helped my friends meet each other and grow their networks too.

We're lucky in Toronto to be able to find each other so easily. Sometimes I think about how if I was living in the United States right now in red state how impossible it would feel without anyone else around me. Nonetheless, I see many people from these places still finding a way because that's how important this is to us. No matter the constraints, if it's true to who we are we find a way.

A few years ago I went to an event in Las Vegas for gender nonconforming folks, and I met people who had no one else to share their identity with back home. The importance of this event for them was tremendous, and they had travelled long distances spent exorbitant amounts of money to have the opportunity to feel like part of a community that didn't judge them.

My friend and I have discussed returning to Vegas for event like this again but the cost in time and money seems a little bit high, considering all the opportunity we have at home.
