### This is dedicated to my friends and family who have been supportive to me throughout this 

It is sometimes hard to share my experience with people, either because the subject matter is too heavy to bring up in casual conversation, or the right questions are never really asked. There remain things I would like to share, or would at least like to give you the option to hear about so that you might understand me better.

### This story is divided into many segments.
You can read them in a chronological order, or sort them by a few different scales I have graded each essay on (Empowerment score, Happiness score, Humor Score). I don't necessarily think that chronology is as important as following curiosity and mood.

You may read however many short essays as you'd like before reading some closing words.

Thank you for taking the time to see me
