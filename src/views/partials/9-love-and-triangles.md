## Love and Triangles

Earlier this week I ended the first relationship I’ve ever had through Fetlife. Coincidentally it was also my first time having a boyfriend and falling in love with a man. Beyond that there were a lot of other firsts and I grew as a person in the 5 months we spent texting or audio/video calling every day. 

Ultimately a few things brought it to the ground:

1. Distance. I was skeptical from the start I could handle this. I gave it an honest try but despite them being just an hour drive away, it was too much like a long distance relationship.

2. White lies. While I don’t think my partner was a blatantly dishonest person, they withheld information a few too many times and it started to add up to major distrust. Patterns repeated that I couldn’t stay naive about any longer.

3. Polyamory practiced poorly. My ex was extremely busy with work, a divorce and a child. Nonetheless he was intent on having 2 poly partners both of whom he couldn’t see enough. This other partner and I never spoke but I was blocked on FL one day without a word and I suspect it was out of jealousy that he and I went on a fancy date one night. Honestly I can’t blame her either because I would feel jealous of her too. We were both with a partner who wasn’t making enough time for us and further dividing his time between us. I strongly believe trying to tackle a bunch of poorly developed poly relationships simultaneously is a death sentence. It’s really hard to believe someone genuinely loves you when it seems like they are also testing your patience and understanding to see how far they can push the limits of your tolerance.

After having evening plans changed from a Thursday evening to during my work day, and our following Tuesday evening plans completely cancelled without backup plans, I started to see a pattern emerging. My kindness was being exploited for weakness. I was getting less because I was tolerating it. For one of the first times in my life I had met someone who fulfilled so many of my validation needs as a trans woman that I was going blind to some of mistreatment and marginalization happening simultaneously.

I broke it off Tuesday morning and wept uncontrollably for hours. Collapsed in my shower and sobbed as hard as I could, cursed his name, and grieved the loss of potential. I grieved the loss of connection and not feeling fought harder for.
Then another thing happened - I started breathing sighs of relief. The many stresses I’d let stay on my shoulders as I navigated the poly, the distance and the lies of omission started to fade away. It became clear the relationship was more toxic for me than I could see clearly from the inside. 

I will end this with some gratitude. I am grateful for the confidence he gave me to love myself in less makeup, without my long blonde wig on, wearing sweats. I was never not beautiful in his eyes no matter how little I tried. I know this is something that has taught me to want more for myself and expect men to see beauty in me without a big facade of clothes and makeup.

2024 has been such a wonderful year so far and it’s not stopping now. Upward and onward!
