## Where to begin?

If you're expecting a clear cut explanation of how I have strongly identified with being a woman my whole life, you won't find it here. In my mid 30s I started coming to realize I was trans and, truthfully, I resisted believing it for a long time even as I took steps to transition to an existence that felt more authentic to me.

We are often looking for a clear cut origin story. That's not always the case. For some trans folks out there it has been this clear, but for many of us it's been far from anything easily summarized in a sentence or two. There is a pressure out there in society to have some story that justifies our existence and why it all makes sense. I've realized it overinvestigating the past for justifications at every step in life can become an exhausting task. And for what? So you can compile a little story for the skeptical that proves you are valid? No.

If someone tells you they are trans, believe them. Simple as that. No matter how they look, or how they act. I know many of us have relied on clear gender markers for social cues our whole lives, but this is problematic. Holding trans people accountable to act or present a particular way becomes a direct statement on how cisgender men and women are expected to be. You really can't separate one from the other. You can't aim to control how we express ourselves without controlling how everyone expresses themselves. This is why the more politicized we become, the more you hear about cis people being accused of being trans because they didnt fit some person's ideal of what a man or woman should be like.

With that out of the way we are more free to focus on the stories. No further question of "Is or isn't this person what they say they are?". I am. Now simply hear my stories and understand some of the experiences that have shaped me, built my confidence and helped me share this very outlook.

I am never not valid. These short essays are a glance into my journey.
