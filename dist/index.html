<p><strong>Content Warning</strong> This is an interactive storytelling experiment with strong adult themes including explicit language, discussions of sexual orientation and gender, trans misogyny, queer hookup culture and more.</p>
<h3>This is dedicated to my friends and family who have been supportive to me throughout this</h3>
<p>It is sometimes hard to share my experience with people, either because the subject matter is too heavy to bring up in casual conversation, or the right questions are never really asked. There remain things I would like to share, or would at least like to give you the option to hear about so that you might understand me better.</p>
<h3>This story is divided into many segments.</h3>
<p>You can read them in a chronological order, or sort them by a few different scales I have graded each essay on (Empowerment score, Happiness score, Humor Score). I don't necessarily think that chronology is as important as following curiosity and mood.</p>
<p>You may read however many short essays as you'd like before reading some closing words.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to see me</p>

</section><section id="1"><h2>Where to begin?</h2>
<p>If you're expecting a clear cut explanation of how I have strongly identified with being a woman my whole life, you won't find it here. In my mid 30s I started coming to realize I was trans and, truthfully, I resisted believing it for a long time even as I took steps to transition to an existence that felt more authentic to me.</p>
<p>We are often looking for a clear cut origin story. That's not always the case. For some trans folks out there it has been this clear, but for many of us it's been far from anything easily summarized in a sentence or two. There is a pressure out there in society to have some story that justifies our existence and why it all makes sense. I've realized it overinvestigating the past for justifications at every step in life can become an exhausting task. And for what? So you can compile a little story for the skeptical that proves you are valid? No.</p>
<p>If someone tells you they are trans, believe them. Simple as that. No matter how they look, or how they act. I know many of us have relied on clear gender markers for social cues our whole lives, but this is problematic. Holding trans people accountable to act or present a particular way becomes a direct statement on how cisgender men and women are expected to be. You really can't separate one from the other. You can't aim to control how we express ourselves without controlling how everyone expresses themselves. This is why the more politicized we become, the more you hear about cis people being accused of being trans because they didnt fit some person's ideal of what a man or woman should be like.</p>
<p>With that out of the way we are more free to focus on the stories. No further question of &quot;Is or isn't this person what they say they are?&quot;. I am. Now simply hear my stories and understand some of the experiences that have shaped me, built my confidence and helped me share this very outlook.</p>
<p>I am never not valid. These short essays are a glance into my journey.</p>
</section><section id="2"><h2>Discretion</h2>
<h3>&quot;Are you discreet?&quot;</h3>
<h3>&quot;Do you live alone&quot;</h3>
<h3>&quot;Do your neighbours know?&quot;</h3>
<p>Once upon a time I was all too familiar with regularly tolerating these questions from people, because I was closeted then too. These days the word &quot;discreet&quot; is complete repellant. Over a period of exploration I quickly came to recognize that there was so much trouble with discretion I never really understood from the outside. I'll give a reasons why:</p>
<h4>1. Meeting sketchier people</h4>
<p>When you're discreet, you're navigate a world of anonymity. The more anonymous you are, the more it seems people treat you like you are just an NPC in their adventure. The selfishness I have seen people exhibit is mind boggling. The information people deliberatly choose to omit can be shocking. The respect they have for your time is non-existent. It just leads to a much higher rate of asking yourself &quot;Who the fuck did I just let into my home?&quot;.</p>
<h4>2. Your own discretion can be exploited</h4>
<p>There are people out there looking to prey on discretion and inexperience. It doesn't really matter how old you are, when you start exploring you are vulnerable. People can also leverage the ideas of blackmailing you with the threat of exposure. They don't even need to do it, they can just raise the idea even as a threat and cause you enough stress.</p>
<h4>3. Discreet people don't test</h4>
<p>There is a strong correlation between discretion and not taking sexual health seriously. For example: A married man who is discreetly looking for sex with other men and trans women is not telling his doctor about his sexual activity. He is not getting regular STI checks, he is not taking HIV prevention medication. He is discreet, and all of these things need names, identification, phone calls, paper trail etc..</p>
<h4>4. Discreet folks frequently reinforce homophobias and transphobias</h4>
<p>If you are still in the closet you are likely wrestling with a lot of challenges around what your family, friends and workplace might say or think if they knew this about you. When you haven't overcome those problems yourself, it's really hard not to project them on others.</p>
<p>I don't think this is a particularly exhaustive list of all the problems with discretion, but I hope it's enough to paint a clear picture why being out is safer for one's mental and physical health than hiding.</p>
</section><section id="3"><h2>Fear</h2>
<p>When I was still closeted, I tried to have a more serious relationship dynamic with someone. It started with warmth and attention, but within 5 days he was attempting Total Power Exchange with me non-consensually.</p>
<p>I had a trans friend I was lightly dating and he told me to break it off with her, and I did, but we still had a movie night planned that week just as friends. Nonetheless I was still accused of being unfaithful and not texting him enough during the movie night and he was livid with me. I remember this moment vividly where I was with my friend, Anna, and I picked up my phone to see a message from him saying I didn‚Äôt text him enough, and Anna just saw my body language totally shift into a pensive, distracted state, and we had to wrap this up shortly after so I could deal with it. When she left, despite my explaining he was insistent I was unfaithful. I was telling him he was pushing my limits but he refused to back down and just made me feel like unworthy trash. We argued so much and he just wanted me to yield to him. My limits didn‚Äôt matter.</p>
<p>In any case I dumped him that night. Then he started persuing my direct friends shortly after, including Anna! He shit talked a bunch about me to one friend because we had a shared online photo together. Honestly, I don‚Äôt know how he thought shit talking a trans girl to another trans girl was going to work out in his favour, but he tried.</p>
<p>In any case, I felt a bit terrorized by him for a little while, both at the conclusion of our short engagement as well as the subsequent weeks. I admittedly feel a little damaged by it.</p>
<p>I flashbacks to being completely scorned for disappointing my partner.</p>
<p>I guess I just wanted to share this so you know a little of my past trying to seek dynamics and if I am odd or fragile about something I might be me re-wiring my brain a little away from a traumatic past relationship.</p>
<p>It was one of the last people I met before I concluded I HAD to come out to family for my own safety and wellness, because predators lurk in the discreet corners of queer dating.</p>
</section><section id="4"><h2>Friendship</h2>
<p>While I was still in the closet, I had a strong desire to make friends and not just seek sexual relationships with people. My friend Alex and I met through a dating site and seemed to have a mutual interest in friendship. We set up plans for one Friday evening to hang out at their place. When I got to Alex's place, we hit it off right away. This was one of the first times I had met a trans person, seeking friendship and felt so comfortable and human. We had drinks, shared laughs and got theoretical about gender with one another very quickly. It was nice to meet someone a similar age, working in a similar field who understood what I was going through so well, and had navigated that journey already. What I did not expect that evening, however, was for Alex to propose that we go out to a bar together with their other friends who they had invited over. Quickly an evening that I thought was going to be a quiet hang turned into my first night out.</p>
<p>I was conflicted about taking the step into public for the first time. It wasn't so much because I was afraid of how anyone would react to seeing me, so much is the fact that I still wasn't out with my family. I wanted to talk to them first before I ever left my home because I just didn't want to risk getting caught and them learning from anyone else. Simultaneously the act of stepping out would bring a lot of clarity about things that I had on my mind, which could help me find the strength. There was a bit of a chicken and egg problem at hand in terms of what would help move me forward to coming out.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I decided to join them that night, and it was a life-changing experience. Over the next couple weeks I chatted with Alex several more times and talked a lot about the strong desire I had now to start talking to my parents. I wasn't really sure of what kind of labels to use and the wrong one felt like it could be a trap of expectations. So with Alex's help, I realized queer was the best label for me to break the ice with. The term queer is great in the sense that it has no clear expectations around what it means. It just indicates you're a little different and capable of anything.</p>
<p>Shortly after that chat with Alex I spoke with my family. Overall reception was positive and a new sense of comfort and freedom overcame me. I didn't have to hide my face any longer.</p>
<p>I'm so grateful to the friendship I made with Alex that got me over the hump. It's hard to explain just how important friends can be to helping you see things more clearly and finding the self worth and courage within you.</p>
</section><section id="5"><h2>Mentors</h2>
<p>After I came out to my family. I started finding it a lot easier to make friends. This became my highest priority. The night I first met Alex I was also introduced to Natalia, my first mentor. Natalia and I quickly bonded over passions for make up and dress. I admired Natalia a lot for the confidence that she demonstrated and the fallibility she showed as she worked to improve her presentation. She was always great about giving constructive feedback if you were interested, but never pushy either.</p>
<p>Over many months, Natalia and I made plans to hang out in the lgbtq village of Toronto night after night. We had a shared drive to grow and experiment with makeup and dress. She pushed me in ways that I wanted to be pushed because I didn't want to be an awkward, looking crossdresser in the back of the room. I wanted to be able to hold my head high in pride at the skills I had developed. Confidence in dress, was confidence in life.</p>
<p>Around the same time, I made friends with a trans woman from Dubai named Lorna. She just about stunned me the first time I met her because her makeup and dress were so well put together. She had a clear sense of taste for higher fashion and the same passion for improvement that I shared with Natalia. Lorna would visit Toronto from time to time for a few weeks or a month and when she was in town she was eager to get out and socialize. We would meet for drinks, chat over martinis and compliment each other's outfits and makeup. We would chat about navigating men and it's many challenges.</p>
<p>Natalia and Lorna both had reasons to leave Toronto at a similar time the following Spring and it left me very empty for a while to lose these friends. Without them I had worried I'd have no one to get drinks and watch amateur drag with at the Well on a Wednesday night. No one to go dancing with at El Convento Rico on a Saturday. I had grown so much with them, but it was time for the training wheels to come off and find my own independence.</p>
</section><section id="6"> <h2>Community</h2>
<p>Over the course of the last few years, I've managed to make a lot of friends with other trans women and other gender non-conforming folks. There's been a lot of positive outcomes from this that I couldn't have necessarily predicted. After I came out to my family, I started opening my home to guests and hosting small parties for friends. Small parties grew into medium size parties, and medium size parties grew into ones about as big as I could fit in my place.</p>
<p>Through social media, dating sites, chat groups, and other peoples connections, I've managed to form quite a network of supportive people around me and also helped my friends meet each other and grow their networks too.</p>
<p>We're lucky in Toronto to be able to find each other so easily. Sometimes I think about how if I was living in the United States right now in red state how impossible it would feel without anyone else around me. Nonetheless, I see many people from these places still finding a way because that's how important this is to us. No matter the constraints, if it's true to who we are we find a way.</p>
<p>A few years ago I went to an event in Las Vegas for gender nonconforming folks, and I met people who had no one else to share their identity with back home. The importance of this event for them was tremendous, and they had travelled long distances spent exorbitant amounts of money to have the opportunity to feel like part of a community that didn't judge them.</p>
<p>My friend and I have discussed returning to Vegas for event like this again but the cost in time and money seems a little bit high, considering all the opportunity we have at home.</p>
</section><section id="7"><h2>Pay It Forward</h2>
<p>After spending enough time, building my own confidence existing in public and thriving with the help of friendships, I felt like I wanted to give more back to people who were in the situation I once was.</p>
<p>From time to time when navigating social media and dating sites you will meet folks who say they look up to you and want your help. Who would I be to deny this to anyone who spoke to me after such an extension of gratuity from others helped me?</p>
<p>I have tried on many occasions with varying levels of success to help other people come out in public. Unfortunately, I have also seen many people disappear on me suddenly, come up with excuses, or simply admitthey don't think they're ready when the time comes.</p>
<p>This can be frustrating to deal with because you will spend time warming up to someone and trying to champion for them before they deliver that news that they can't really go through with what they asked you for. It's important to remain patient through these experiences and just let people do things in their own time but that doesn't mean that you have to wait for them to be ready and entertain their indecision. Give them a shot and if it doesn't work out, let them know that they may have to try with someone else when ready. Encourage them not to give up if this is important to them.</p>
<p>One other thing that can be very challenging with navigating the closeted is that they will inevitably harbour a lot of internalized transphobia, and that can be projected on you. This is actually potentially one of the riskiest parts of helping people in situations like these, because you should not be letting yourself be brought down in order to try to bring them up. In my opinion, it is better to hold yourself in high standard and not waiver, because you set a better example of who they need to become by not placating their apprehensions.</p>
<p>Help who you can. Don't burn yourself out. You come first and you still set a good examplefor them by existing alone.</p>
</section><section id="8"><h2>Chasers</h2>
<p>A 'chaser' is a cis man who can't get his shit together when it comes to his trans attraction. In the process of navigating his own bi-curiosity he contacts trans women to mostly objectify them, flop on plans made, and compartmentalize them in a space reserved for fetishes.</p>
<p>'Admirer' is a term you also hear for trans-attracted men that can behave a bit more appropriately, though that doesn't necessarily mean they want to do anything other than send polite praise and encouragement from a distance.</p>
<p>What this adds up to is an inordinate number of trans-attracted men not showing up for us when push comes to shove, that is, anywhere but private quarters.</p>
<p>I've had men interested in me forwardly say they are straight, as though I'm deeply interested in their orientation. I don't really care. What I know for sure is that gay men aren't into me, because gay men are looking for masculine men. So if you're seeking to meet trans women, you aren't doing what gay men do.</p>
<p>I have many trans friends who date other trans women and avoid navigating cis men altogether. I get it. Even though I feel mostly attracted to men these days, I find myself frequently thinking I could deal with so much less garbage treatment, so much less trans misogyny, if I just dated other trans women.</p>
<p>Trans/Trans romance is often abbreviated as T4T. I have found T4T oriented folks often have an extremely low opinion of chasers/admirers and little to no sympathy for their circumstances. I find myself on the other side of this though. I feel like finding ways to build trans attracted men up and reduce the stigma would improve things for all trans women, because it implies a societal shift in public opinion. It would also hold them accountable to better behavior if we publicly accepted dating trans women as normal.</p>
<p>What this looks like exactly, I'm not sure. I can almost hear the hisses and boos from trans women as I say &quot;Can we give them a chance? Can we do something to make this space better for them too?&quot;. Afterall, for all the mistreatment they feed us, why would we owe them a damn thing?</p>
<p>Both ourselves and the chasers are living in a society that stigmatizes us for what we like and how we live. We both need that stigma to go away. Shame drives men to compartmentalize these feelings. Compartmentalizing the feelings makes them come out in weird ways. Trans women end up experiencing the results of those weird outbursts first hand on socials, dating sites, and on quiet street corners when noone else is around. It hurts our safety and our mental health.</p>
<p>So what is the potential solution? I think one solution could be safer community spaces for interacting together. Meetups with strict codes of conduct that protect trans women against harassment. Creating a safe space for trans women to meet each other as first priority, then letting allies and admirers in to events that explicitly welcome them, after trans community trust is strongly established. This is just an idea that I'm currently working on and will potentially try to organize in the future.</p>
</section><section id="9"><h2>Love and Triangles</h2>
<p>Earlier this week I ended the first relationship I‚Äôve ever had through Fetlife. Coincidentally it was also my first time having a boyfriend and falling in love with a man. Beyond that there were a lot of other firsts and I grew as a person in the 5 months we spent texting or audio/video calling every day.</p>
<p>Ultimately a few things brought it to the ground:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Distance. I was skeptical from the start I could handle this. I gave it an honest try but despite them being just an hour drive away, it was too much like a long distance relationship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>White lies. While I don‚Äôt think my partner was a blatantly dishonest person, they withheld information a few too many times and it started to add up to major distrust. Patterns repeated that I couldn‚Äôt stay naive about any longer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Polyamory practiced poorly. My ex was extremely busy with work, a divorce and a child. Nonetheless he was intent on having 2 poly partners both of whom he couldn‚Äôt see enough. This other partner and I never spoke but I was blocked on FL one day without a word and I suspect it was out of jealousy that he and I went on a fancy date one night. Honestly I can‚Äôt blame her either because I would feel jealous of her too. We were both with a partner who wasn‚Äôt making enough time for us and further dividing his time between us. I strongly believe trying to tackle a bunch of poorly developed poly relationships simultaneously is a death sentence. It‚Äôs really hard to believe someone genuinely loves you when it seems like they are also testing your patience and understanding to see how far they can push the limits of your tolerance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After having evening plans changed from a Thursday evening to during my work day, and our following Tuesday evening plans completely cancelled without backup plans, I started to see a pattern emerging. My kindness was being exploited for weakness. I was getting less because I was tolerating it. For one of the first times in my life I had met someone who fulfilled so many of my validation needs as a trans woman that I was going blind to some of mistreatment and marginalization happening simultaneously.</p>
<p>I broke it off Tuesday morning and wept uncontrollably for hours. Collapsed in my shower and sobbed as hard as I could, cursed his name, and grieved the loss of potential. I grieved the loss of connection and not feeling fought harder for.
Then another thing happened - I started breathing sighs of relief. The many stresses I‚Äôd let stay on my shoulders as I navigated the poly, the distance and the lies of omission started to fade away. It became clear the relationship was more toxic for me than I could see clearly from the inside.</p>
<p>I will end this with some gratitude. I am grateful for the confidence he gave me to love myself in less makeup, without my long blonde wig on, wearing sweats. I was never not beautiful in his eyes no matter how little I tried. I know this is something that has taught me to want more for myself and expect men to see beauty in me without a big facade of clothes and makeup.</p>
<p>2024 has been such a wonderful year so far and it‚Äôs not stopping now. Upward and onward!</p>
</section><section id="10"><h2>Clarity</h2>
<p>In May of 2024 I finished coming out with my family. As of writing this that's actually only a few weeks ago. There was a 2 1/2 year gap between when I told my parents that I'm queer and when I told them I'm trans.</p>
<p>Finding the clarity of mind to finish the job was no easy task. A lot of things that I do in my life I do by gut feeling. I wait until until my gut tells me I'm ready and then I get the task done. Since the winter time I had known, I was approaching a state of readiness to talk to them. However, I found myself frequently choked up and overwhelmed with emotions when I started to prepare what I would say to them.</p>
<p>Telling my parents that I was queer was orders of magnitude easier than it felt to tell them that I was trans. For a very long time I have wished that I was just gay. Growing up in the 90s, there were not a lot of great models for gender non-conforming people in the media or public. My mind was filled with worry that if I only told my parents without showing them who I am their mind would race to the same kind of negative images and associations I had grown up with. I was worried that all the skeptical anti-trans journalism would shape too much of their opinion. I worried that if I showed them first without telling them it would come as a shock and make starting a grounded conversation difficult.</p>
<p>I didn't really get over those fears before calling them one Sunday. I think I just got exhausted by worrying about those things and my gut finally told me I was ready enough champion through what I needed to say.</p>
<p>The news was as well recieved as one could expect from family. Telling them I was queer a few years prior had helped give them time to adjust, learn more on their own and be prepared to hear these things. We planned to meet for dinner at a restaurant 2 days later and finished delivering all pertinent information, with time for Q&amp;A. I also sent them pictures of myself immediately after the phone call, just so there was no extended period of time spent wondering what they would see.</p>
<p>It's really hard to put into words what coming out to a supportive family feels like. After finishing the job I had a moment of confusion where I almost didnt know what to do next. So much of my mind has been occupied by this problem, it was like having new free time I didn't know what to do with. In the coming days I saw what that empty space made room for though. A sense of balance, and control over my life. I felt like my parents' child again instead of a failed project. With that feeling has some a greater capacity to share love, passion, and gratitude.</p>
</section><section id="outro"><h2>Outro</h2>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to read as much or as little of this as interested you.</p>
<p>Depending on how much you read, or the order you read it in, you may draw different conclusions about who I am or how I'm doing these days. The short answer is <strong>Really Awesome</strong>. Life continues to improve every day. I'm grateful again for my supportive friends and family through this.</p>
<p>The other day someone was telling me about how I was brave. While I don't disagree that it takes steps of courage along the way to drive forward, I'm not sure I see myself as particularly brave. It has felt like something I just needed to do, because the alternatives were worse. It feels more like getting out of quicksand. Why would I be brave for escaping quicksand? That's just survival.
Despite navigating new challenges, quality of life has gone up. The brighter I shine, the easier navigating or completely avoiding the junkier side of trans journeys has become because I'm built on top of it.</p>
<p>Peace, Love, Unity and Respect,</p>
